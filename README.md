# Income-Prediction-with-Census-Data

## Project Description
This project aims to build a predictive model for Canadians’ income level using data from the 2016 Census of Population Public Use Microdata File, as well as to distinguish key determinants of income in the Canadian context. The project was conducted between January and April 2023. At that time, the 2016 Census data was the most recent dataset available.  

## Data Source
The dataset for this project is the 2016 Census of Population Public Use Microdata File (individuals file), which includes 930,421 observations and 123 individual and family-related socioeconomic features, along with an estimated weight that is attached to each observation to ensure the sample’s representativeness of the population.

## Descriptive Analytics  
To understand the income distribution in Canada, this project analyzes income patterns across four key features:  
- **Industry Sector** – Examines how income varies by industry.  
- **Occupation** – Identifies income differences across job roles.  
- **Highest Degree Obtained** – Assesses the impact of education on income levels.  
- **Age** – Explores income trends across different age groups.
